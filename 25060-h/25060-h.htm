      The anchor of her Majesty's ship <i>Hannibal</i> was underfoot and the
      captain on the bridge, and Rear-Admiral Garnet had shaken hands with the
      last of the &ldquo;leading&rdquo; Fijian white residents, who always did the welcoming
      and farewelling when distinguished persons visited Levuka, when Lieutenant
      Bollard approached him and intimated that &ldquo;a person&rdquo; from the shore had
      just come alongside in a boat and desired to see &ldquo;his Excellency on
      private and important business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil does the fellow want?&rdquo; said the Admiral irascibly, not a
      whit softened by the &ldquo;his Excellency&rdquo; style of address; &ldquo;I'm going on the
      bridge, and can't see any one now; we can't delay the ship and get into a
      mess going through the passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told him so, sir; but he says he wants to see you upon an important&mdash;a
      most pressing matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well! Confound him! Let the sentry show him to my cabin, and tell
      Captain Bracely I shall be up in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;person,&rdquo; conducted by the sentry, was shown into the cabin, where the
      Admiral, without taking a seat or offering one to his visitor, inquired
      with a cold, cautious politeness born of much experience of island
      visitors with &ldquo;important and private Service matters of great urgency,&rdquo;
       what he might be pleased to want?
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was a short, fat, coarse-looking man with little pig-like
      eyes and scanty tufts of black beard and whiskers growing in irregular
      patches on his cheeks and chin, like clumps of gorse on clayey banks. He
      was dressed&mdash;in a manner&mdash;in an ill-fitting black cloth suit
      imported from Sydney. His hair was very black and shiny, plastered down
      over his temples and beautifully parted at the back of his bullet head.
      Altogether he was an unpleasantly sleek, oleaginous creature, and as he
      stood bowing and smirking with a catlike grin, the Admiral felt an almost
      irresistible impulse to kick him out of the cabin. Notwithstanding his
      haste, however, he began to recollect the man as an individual who had
      been introduced to him a few days previously at some municipal function.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't recollect the fellow's name,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;I wonder
      what the devil the creature wants! Got a complaint against the Consul very
      likely&mdash;every one has a complaint against a Consul&mdash;it's a
      disease in the South Seas. Confound their twopenny-halfpenny squabbles!&rdquo;
       Then the little fat man, with another servile grin, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, your Excellency, to see you upon a matter which I think, as a
      loyal subject, it is my duty&mdash;my painful duty&mdash;to bring under
      your notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought as much,&rdquo; said the Admiral to himself. &ldquo;Some row about a trader
      insulting a native teacher, or <i>vice-versa</i>.&rdquo; Then smothering an
      exclamation of impatience, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, sir? I have no time to lose. By the way, who are you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name, your Excellency, is Obadiah Howl-man. I had the distinguished
      honour, your Excellency, of showing your Excellency over the grounds of
      the new Mission College. I was the contractor for the erection of that
      ornament to our little town.&rdquo; And again the oily creature smirked and
      bowed and did the invisible soap business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely <i>you</i> are not a missionary, sir?&rdquo; asked the Admiral, with
      undisguised contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not, your Excellency. That is, I am not yet an ordained labourer in
      the Vineyard, your Excellency; but I hope soon to be one. Meanwhile, all
      the time that is left to me from my business (I am a storekeeper and
      contractor) is given to the cause of spreading the Light I was once a lost
      soul, your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; interrupted the Admiral, with ill-disguised disgust and
      open impatience, &ldquo;but do, for Heaven's sake, tell me what is your
      complaint. I am due in Sydney on the tenth of this month, and the ship is
      already under way. As it is, we shall have to stop outside the reef to let
      you get into your boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of it, your Excellency, and I should not have ventured to
      detain you, but this is a very serious matter&mdash;I may say, a criminal
      matter. When I had the honour of meeting your Excellency, on the occasion
      of your Excellency's visit to the College, I would have spoken of this
      matter then; but my poor, weak nature was so torn by conflicting emotions
      that I <i>could</i> not And for the past two nights have I struggled and
      wrestled in spirit, and sought Divine guidance. 'Tis indeed hard for one
      man to reveal the sins and wickedness of a fellow-sinner&mdash;knowing
      that we are all but weak vessels. But yet in this case it is my bounden
      duty as a loyal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;go on, for Heaven's sake! What on earth is the matter? And
      what the deuce do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency, I wish, in all sorrow and tribulation of spirit, to give
      you information as to the whereabouts of a deserter from her Majesty's
      Navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, sir? None of my men are missing, and if any were, I'd
      tell the Fijian police about it, and not delay the <i>Hannibal</i>,&rdquo; and
      with a curt nod the Admiral turned on his heel and was about to leave the
      cabin, when the man stepped forward and interrupted him, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more, your Excellency. There is in connection with this case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reward. Yes, of course. I forgot all about that. If there is a
      deserter from any of her Majesty's ships living ashore here, you will get
      the usual reward, I have no doubt. But really, sir, this is a matter that
      you must arrange with the police when the next man-of-war comes here, or
      go to the Consul&rdquo;&mdash;and then, <i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;&ldquo;or the devil,
      confound you!&rdquo; and the Admiral more than ever felt inclined to kick his
      visitor out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You quite mistake me, Admiral Garnet I have no wish to claim an earthly
      reward for doing my duty to my Queen and country. Since I have lived in
      these islands the Lord has prospered me in my worldly affairs, and I am in
      a position far above taking payment in money for doing my duty. I am, I
      trust, walking in the Light, and do not want to obtain wealth&mdash;which
      is but of this world&mdash;for performing such duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I am sure I beg your pardon, Mr. Howlman. But now I really
      cannot talk any longer here, so please do not keep me. At the same time if
      there is a deserter here I don't see what business it is of yours to
      interest yourself in his capture. Don't you think you have enough to do to
      look after your store, and contracting, and your <i>alleged</i> missionary
      business, without running after deserters?&rdquo; And inwardly the Admiral
      cursed his visitor for a meddlesome ass. He was in a hurry to get to sea,
      and yet this fellow might make it necessary for the ship to be delayed
      till the deserter was apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My humble connection with missionaries, Admiral, has taught me that, at
      whatever cost to my own feelings, my duty as a loyal subject must, next to
      my duty as a Christian, be performed honestly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes. That's all right, I meant no disrespect to the
      missionaries. Many of the <i>gentlemen</i> engaged in missionary work in
      these islands have rendered very valuable services to her Majesty's ships
      on many occasions,&rdquo; and then to himself, &ldquo;and given us a devil of a lot of
      trouble as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; the Admiral resumed, &ldquo;having explained that the Consul or
      police will attend to this deserter, you will allow me to say 'Good-day.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment more, sir,&rdquo; and a spiteful green lit up the little piggish
      eyes. &ldquo;I desire, as a British subject, to speak to you privately on this
      matter, and to you alone. There are reasons&mdash;very particular reasons&mdash;why
      her Majesty's Consul or the Fiji police here cannot deal with this case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; sighed the Admiral resignedly; &ldquo;sit down, Mr. Howlman. I see I
      am in for it, and so I'll send for my secretary and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot this matter be arranged without a third party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it CANNOT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Admiral said this with so much emphasis, and rang the bell with so
      much force at the same moment, that the sentry almost jumped into the
      cabin to see what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass the word for Mr. Hayling to come to my cabin, and to the captain
      that I shall not be with him for ten minutes yet. Ten minutes will do your
      business, Mr. Howlman, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, your Excellency,&rdquo; and an evil smile crossed the man's
      repulsive features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marine saluted, the secretary appeared, and the Admiral, nodding
      towards Mr. Howlman in anything but a friendly manner, growled: &ldquo;My
      secretary, Mr. Hayling. This is Mr. Howlman, Mr. Hayling; he has a
      communication to make about a deserter. Now, sir, proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the man, producing a photograph and laying it on the table,
      &ldquo;is a portrait of a person named George Barcom, who, I have every reason
      to believe, was a sergeant of marines on the <i>Flycatcher</i> when she
      was on this station five years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take charge of that photograph, Mr. Hayling. Go ahead, Mr. Howlman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man, after deserting from the <i>Flycatcher</i> at a place in this
      group called Yasawa, managed to make his way to the island of Niuafou,
      where at that time I was in temporary charge of the Christian Cultivation
      Association's trading station. He came to the island in an open boat from
      the Yasawa Group, and was not suspected until quite recently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuced long time finding him out. But proceed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty as the man was of the crime of desertion, I must yet, perforce,
      say that he behaved himself very well. He was kindly received by the King
      Tepuaka (a very earnest seeker after the Light), and all went well for the
      space of four years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what happened then? Five minutes left,&rdquo; and the Admiral looked at
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My story will soon be told, your Excellency. The man, who calls himself
      George Barcom, gained the affections of Tuilagi,{*} the youngest daughter
      of the King. She, although not a seeker after the truth, was yet beginning
      to display some interest in the teachings of Christianity, and was an
      exceedingly comely young woman.&rdquo; Here Mr. Howlman clasped his fat hands
      together and cast up his eyes. &ldquo;But her father, at my suggestion, objected
      to their union. One night Barcom and the poor, misguided girl were
      missing. They had fled in an open boat to another island called Anuda&mdash;one
      of those dark places of the earth where the good seed has not yet been
      sown.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Tuilagi&mdash;&ldquo;Queen of the Sky&rdquo;; a name common in Polynesia.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was the nature and reason of your objection to their marriage?&rdquo;
       said the Admiral quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had every reason by this time to believe that the man was a deserter,
      and in my capacity as a preacher of the Gospel&mdash;though not ordained
      as such&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confine yourself to the subject, if you please,&rdquo; interrupted the Admiral,
      with a mingled look of impatience and disgust. &ldquo;You are not a missionary,
      you tell me, and I'm hanged if I'm going to listen to a sermon in my own
      cabin just now. Yet I have already given you as much of my time as if you
      were one. But don't trespass on my good nature too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it my duty to interfere and prevent such a wicked and improper
      marriage. And, your Excellency, this carrying away the young woman against
      her father's wishes was very detrimental to the progress of the Mission
      work. As I have said, she was beginning to evince a certain concern for
      her soul&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, man! why will you so persistently harp upon irrevelant
      matters that do not, as far as I can see, possibly concern what you really
      want to tell me? Have you a brief to speak for the missionaries? I am
      acquainted with the principal <i>gentlemen</i> (again he emphasised the
      word) who conduct mission work in the South Seas, but I'll be hanged if I
      ever heard your name before&mdash;not even as a house-builder, or whatever
      your vocation is.&rdquo; And then, with a quick glance at the cunning visage of
      Howlman, he added, &ldquo;I suppose you knew this young woman very well&mdash;perhaps
      were a particular friend of hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Obadiah Howlman coughed. &ldquo;Hm&mdash;er. Well, your Excellency, my dear
      wife, who has now departed to her rest&mdash;an indeed well-earned rest&mdash;when
      alive, took much interest in this young girl, and, before she was called
      away, besought me to cherish and protect her. And, as time went on, there
      <i>was</i> formed, I may say, an attachment between this young creature
      and myself&mdash;that is, of course, such an attachment as could exist
      between a young woman of this kind, yearning for instruction, and her
      spiritual adviser and guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I quite understand, Mr. Howlman. Mr. Hayling has notes of your
      statement, and the photograph. Now, if you will kindly keep your own
      counsel on the matter, you will hear in due course that we have arrested
      this man, and then, I think, you will be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to his secretary, the Admiral said, &ldquo;The <i>Spitfire</i> is
      due at Levuka about the 8th. Write a letter to Commander Arness, and tell
      him to call at Anuda and arrest a deserter from the marines, calling
      himself George Barcom, and who can be identified by this photograph. He is
      the only white man on the island, so this Mr. Howlman says, and there
      should be no difficulty in finding him. That will satisfy you, I presume,
      Mr. Howlman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, sir, I assure you. I have done my duty and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, sir. You will just have time to get into your boat and get
      ashore while we are in smooth water, and before we start the engines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Admiral did not seem to notice the little fat man's outstretched hand.
      The secretary bowed him out of the cabin, holding the photograph in one
      hand and his notebook in the other. Neither of them liked his look well
      enough to shake hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Admiral, however, did not give the order to start the engines
      immediately, for the sentry, in accordance with orders received from the
      secretary, waited till Mr. Obadiah Howlman was at the foot of the
      accommodation-ladder, and then called out, &ldquo;Hold on that boat a minute or
      two; the Admiral wants to send a letter ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For twenty minutes Mr. Howlman waited impatiently in the boat, and then a
      big, official-looking letter was handed down the ladder to the boatman,
      addressed: &ldquo;O.H.M.S.&mdash;Commander Arness, H.M.S. <i>Spitfire</i> care
      of H.B.M. Consul, Levuka, Fiji.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Howlman smiled to himself with the satisfied air of a man who has done
      his duty. He knew the contents of the letter, and recognised through its
      envelope the hard cardboard of the photograph of George Barcom enclosed
      therein. There was also a smaller note, addressed to Commander Arness by
      name, and marked, &ldquo;Private letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later the <i>Hannibal</i> steamed through the passage, and
      shaped a course for Sydney.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The <i>Spitfire</i> was steaming full speed E.S.E. from Levuka. On the
      bridge was Commander Arness talking to the navigating lieutenant, a young
      and almost effeminate-looking officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land had just been sighted, and lay right ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there be daylight enough left for us to get there and have this
      wretched thing over, Carteret?&rdquo; asked Commander Arness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty, sir, if this weather keeps up and you don't want to stay there
      more than a couple of hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Two hours should be ample time. This letter from Hayling explains the
      whole business,&rdquo; and he handed, the lieutenant the despatch from the
      Admiral's secretary, which duly set forth that the <i>Spitfire</i> was to
      take on board a certain white trader living on Anuda&mdash;otherwise,
      Cherry Island&mdash;and bring him prisoner to Sydney. His wife was to be
      returned to her father at Niuafou. The last paragraph in the letter was to
      this effect&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful to identify beyond doubt this alleged deserter. The
      Rear-Admiral has received this information at the instant of sailing, and
      he is by no means certain that the statements of his informant can be
      depended upon. A photograph of the reputed deserter is enclosed herewith.
      The Admiral thinks that Mr. Carteret may know the man, as he was serving
      in the <i>Flycatcher</i> five years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This rascal Howlman has informed upon the poor devil for spite,&rdquo; said the
      Commander; &ldquo;here's a private note from Hayling to myself about the
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant took the note and read&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;My dear Arness,&mdash;Just a line on my own account. Be careful
     what you are doing in this business. The fellow who informed
     is a sort of hanger-on to the missionaries here. They don't
     think much of him, but seem to put up with the swab as a
     necessary evil. He confessed that jealousy had something to
     do with the matter, and I could see the Admiral wanted to
     kick him out of the cabin. Make sure that this man Barcom
     <i>is</i> a deserter, or there will be the devil to pay if he
     should prove to be an American citizen, or anything of that
     kind.&mdash;Yours, CHARLES Hayling.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see why they have left the matter to us, Carteret. You were on the <i>Flycatcher</i>
      five years ago, and the Admiral thinks you may be able to identify this
      fellow. Of course Barcom is not his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carteret at this moment was very busy with the chart, over which he
      bent his head a moment, and then turned sharply to the man at the wheel,
      who was not out of earshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your course,&rdquo; he said sharply; &ldquo;why don't you attend to your
      steering!&rdquo; Then he turned to the commander: &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir; you
      were saying?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying that you ought to remember such an incident as a sergeant of
      marines deserting from the <i>Flycatcher</i> when she was down here five
      years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do remember it. The man's name was Charles Parker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the man?&rdquo; And Arness handed him a photograph of a man dressed in
      white ducks and a straw hat, evidently taken by an amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carteret looked at the photograph for fully a couple of minutes before he
      answered slowly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think that this is the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later the <i>Spitfire</i> had steamed in close to the land,
      and a boat was lowered. In this boat were Lieutenant Carteret, a sergeant
      of marines, with three privates and half a dozen bluejackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have force enough to take a boat-load of deserters,&rdquo; remarked the
      lieutenant to his commander, as he descended the poop ladder on his way to
      the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commander Arness laughed. &ldquo;Oh, well, you know the natives might take it
      into their heads to resist his arrest. But be careful what you are doing:
      make perfectly sure that he <i>is</i> the man. You don't know what
      complications might arise if we carried off the wrong person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The moment the boat touched the shore, she was surrounded by a crowd of
      friendly, brown-skinned islanders, who seemed delighted to see the
      strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one of you fellows speak English?&rdquo; asked Mr. Carteret
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and a big, burly fellow with a fine open countenance advanced
      to the officer. &ldquo;Me speak English, and plenty more men here speak it, too.
      What you want, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any white men living here?&rdquo; asked Carteret quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;one, a very good man; his name is Joajai&rdquo; [George].
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to his house,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;I want to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Mr. Carteret and his marines were being conducted up a
      steep and rugged path towards the white trader's house, which was situated
      quite apart from the native village, while the bluejackets were left in
      the boat, remarking to each other that this white man was a most cursed
      unfriendly sort of a chap not to come down to the beach when he saw a
      man-of-war's boat ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you be such a fool, Tom,&rdquo; said the coxswain to one of the men.
      &ldquo;You're always a-jumpin' at conclusions too rapid. Just you wait a bit and
      see. It's my belief that this chap has been up to something, and the
      marines have gone with Carteret to scruff him and bring him aboard. I saw
      the sergeant had a pair of darbies, and what do you suppose that
      Carteret's come ashore with a regular escort for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ten minutes' walk and Lieutenant Carteret and his men, guided by a
      number of natives, reached the white man's thatched dwelling, which stood
      amid a grove of banana and bread-fruit trees. When within a few yards, the
      lieutenant saw a tall, graceful young native girl, clad in semi-European
      style, advance to the open door, and then with a terrified exclamation
      withdraw again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Tui,{*} Joajai's wife,&rdquo; said one of the natives, pointing to the
      girl, who now again appeared, and, with her full dark eyes dilated with
      alarm, timidly held out her hand to the officer and murmured something in
      the native tongue.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The diminutive of Tuilagi.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She speaks English, but she is afraid of the men with the guns,&rdquo;
       explained the native guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your husband?&rdquo; said Lieutenant Carteret, motioning to the girl
      to seat herself, and the marines to stand back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only shook her head, and turned inquiringly to the natives who
      accompanied the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white man is away on the other side of the island, sir. He be here in
      'bout one half-hour,&rdquo; said the English-speaking native. &ldquo;Suppose you like,
      sir, I send some one go tell him come quick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carteret hesitated a moment, then answered &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then turning to the
      sergeant of marines, he said, &ldquo;Let your men fall still further back,
      sergeant This is a delicate matter, and I don't want this confounded crowd
      of natives, many of whom understand English, to hear what I have to say to
      this woman. Send a man down to the boat, and tell the coxswain that I
      shall have to wait for some time. If the ship makes a signal, the boat can
      go off and tell the captain that I shall have to wait; then she can come
      back for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time the trader's young wife sat trembling upon a rude couch that
      stretched across one side of the room; and her eyes never left the
      officer's face for an instant, save when for a moment she gave a terrified
      glance at the rifles and bayonets of the marine escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment that the marines had fallen back the lieutenant stepped forward
      and took the young woman by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tui,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, drawing her to the further end of the room with
      firm but gentle hand, and speaking so low and without motion of his lips
      that none but she knew that he spoke at all, &ldquo;for God's sake and for mine
      and your husband's, do not be frightened, but listen to me and do exactly
      as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still trembling like a startled fawn, the girl raised her lustrous eyes to
      the young officer's face. His earnest, sincere manner and expression of
      deep concern seemed to reassure her, and though her bosom heaved and her
      breath came in quick, short gasps, she turned her face to him in the
      confidence of dawning hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, sir, and what do you wan' my husban' for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell these natives to go,&rdquo; said the lieutenant &ldquo;Have no fear. I am your
      husband's friend; but, <i>be quick</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, with a wondering look upon her beautiful face, the girl advanced to
      the door, said something in the island tongue to the crowd of curious
      natives, and then gently closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a rum go!&rdquo; said the sergeant of marines to himself, as he saw the
      door shut to. &ldquo;What the devil has the girl been doing? Are the bracelets
      for her, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tui,&rdquo; said Lieutenant Carteret, the moment they were alone, &ldquo;time
      presses. You speak English so well as to thoroughly understand that which
      I am now about to tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered, standing before him with clasped hands, &ldquo;I think
      so. A white woman who is dead now taught me to read and write English, and
      my husban' always talk English to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Then listen to me, my girl. I am Lieutenant Carteret, of H.M.S. <i>Spitfire</i>&mdash;that
      ship out there&mdash;sent here with the ship's police to arrest a deserter
      from the <i>Flycatcher</i> on this station five years ago. This is the
      man's photograph. He is said to be your husband, and calls himself George
      Barcom. Now, when I was an officer of the <i>Flycatcher</i>, I knew a man
      named Charles Parker&rdquo;&mdash;her face went a deadly pallor&mdash;&ldquo;who
      deserted the ship at the Yasawa Group in Fiji. I can, without doubt,
      identify this man. But, Tui, I have looked at this photograph when it was
      held in the hand of my captain, and said that this is <i>not</i> the man
      whom I knew as Charles Parker. But look at it yourself and tell me&mdash;is
      this the photograph of your husband, and is this man on this island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With shaking fingers she took it from him, looked at it, and then raised
      her face to the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the doin' of a man called Obadiah Howlman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the lieutenant, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> the work of Obadiah Howlman.
      He brought this photograph to the Admiral only a few days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A savage gleam came into her eyes. &ldquo;The brute! I kill him for <i>this</i>
      some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not save your husband, my girl,&rdquo; said Carteret; then he waited
      a moment and added, &ldquo;whatever it might do later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the girl's dark eyes filled with tears, and she laid her hand on
      the officer's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, sir? For God's sake don' you take my husband from me,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This</i> can be done. You have seen this photograph. You say that it
      is not that of your husband, don't you? But, Tui, I must do my duty, do
      you understand? I must see your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are the man whose life he saved&mdash;for now I 'member your name
      and the story he told me long ago&mdash;you who say you are his friend,
      you would do this thing, you who in the ship gave him money so that he
      might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, my girl, till I have finished; then you will understand. Listen
      now. I will remain here, and you will yourself find your husband and bring
      him here to this house so that I may see him. Bring him here quickly, and
      by some way that my men cannot see his face. And then, Tui, when I have
      spoken to him, then for your sake and for his sake I will lie, and swear
      he is not the man I have been sent to take. Then, when my ship has gone,
      you&mdash;you and he&mdash;you must promise me this, Tui&mdash;must leave
      this island as quickly as possible; so that when Obadiah Howlman sends
      another warship here&mdash;as he will do&mdash;they may not discover that
      I am a liar and have been false to my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, is this true? Surely you would not tell a lie to a poor native
      girl like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my girl&rdquo;&mdash;and Carteret placed a kindly hand on her shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;go
      quickly to Parker&mdash;I know very well that he is not far off. <i>He</i>
      will believe what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she gazed intently into his face, as if she would read his
      soul; and then seizing his hand pressed it to her lips, and went out by
      the door that opened at the rear of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lieutenant opened the front door and walked slowly across to
      where the marines were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your men out of sight, sergeant. I don't want this fellow frightened
      until I know who he is. If he's the man we want, we'll have no trouble in
      getting him. I've induced his wife to go and bring him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whistling softly in an unconcerned manner, he turned back and stood at the
      door of the house and waited there for perhaps ten minutes, until he saw
      the girl returning with a white man, who appeared to be ill and weak, for
      he had on a heavy top-coat, and a shawl wrapped round his neck in such a
      way that his features were almost entirely hidden.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Lieutenant Carteret allowed the man and woman to enter, and then followed,
      closing the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was inside, the white man threw off his muffler and turned
      towards the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take me, sir,&rdquo; he said, speaking calmly. &ldquo;I cannot let you do
      this for me. I know, sir, that you cannot help yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by Heavens! Parker, I cannot take you. You jumped overboard and saved
      my life. I tell you, man, that I <i>can't</i> do it. Do you think I can
      ever forget that awful thirty minutes, nearly six years ago, when you kept
      me afloat off the Bampton Shoal? Now, Parker, just listen. I have a plan;
      the whole thing is arranged as soon as we leave here. But you and your
      wife <i>must</i> get away from this island soon after the <i>Spitfire</i>
      leaves. That infernal sweep, Howlman, will be sure to send another
      man-of-war after you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, sir. I, too, have a plan. You shall not ruin yourself for
      me. You are only a very young man, sir, and have the world before you. I
      dread nothing but the temporary separation from Tui here. To me my arrest
      means only dismissal from the service and a couple of years in gaol; and
      likely enough, I shall get back here again without much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't waste time, sir. Call the escort, but for God's sake, sir, do the
      thing quickly; look at my girl, sir, and let me get away before I break
      down too, and act the coward. If you don't call the escort at once, I
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You madman, Parker,&rdquo; began Carteret, and then Tui threw her arms round
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you tired of me?&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Is this how you would leave the woman
      who loves you, and who will be the mother of your child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deserter caught her in his arms, and looking over his shoulder at the
      lieutenant, said, &ldquo;For God's sake, sir, don't wait. Call in your men and
      get it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parker, for Heaven's sake take this chance. I tell you, man, that I have
      no fear for myself. I don't care a straw about the Service if this is
      discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside, sir. I'm not the man to let you sacrifice yourself for me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       And unloosing his wife's arms from his neck, he advanced to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; it is your own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next instant the lieutenant threw open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant, bring your men here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Half an hour later Lieutenant Carteret reported to Commander Arness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought the prisoner on board, sir. He is a man named Charles
      Parker, and was sergeant of marines on the <i>Flycatcher?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Mr. Carteret What have you done with his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She refused to leave, sir, and when we brought the man away, went off to
      the other side of the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When the <i>Spitfire</i> reached Sydney, Charles Parker was duly tried by
      court-martial, and in consequence of the friendly exertions of the
      principal witness against him, Lieutenant Neil Carteret, was let off
      lightly. He was dismissed from the service, and sentenced to imprisonment
      in a Sydney jail for eighteen months.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his time had expired, he managed, after a few months of waiting about
      in Sydney, to work his way back to Anuda Island. And scarce had the boat
      touched the beach when he was seized by the welcoming arms of his native
      friends and carried ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it well with my wife, O friends?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well with her,&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;in a little while we will take you
      to her, but first let us tell thee of that which has befallen her on this
      island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they told him.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day after the warship had gone,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;there came here a
      trading schooner from Niuafou. On the ship were Tepuaka, the King of
      Niuafou&mdash;the father of thy wife&mdash;and many of his men. And with
      him there came also the little fat white man named Opataia [Obadiah]. All
      those men that came with Tepuaka, the King, were <i>lotu</i> [Christians].
      No sooner did they land, than Tepuaka and his friend, the fat little white
      man, Opataia, walked to the house of his daughter, thy wife, Tui, but all
      of his men he bade remain here in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'See,' said one of these men of Niuafou to us vauntingly, 'see what has
      come to pass! Tuilagi refused to take for her husband the good and pious
      man Opataia, but fled with this common white man, who is no better than a
      heathen. And then what comes? This bad white man is caught by his
      countrymen and put in a prison with chains upon his body. So now the King
      comes for his daughter, for even now is Opataia willing to take her,
      though she is but of little worth, to my mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While they spoke thus to us, Tepuaka and his white friend had gone to thy
      house, and there did Tui, thy wife, meet them with smiles to hide what lay
      in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Get thee ready, thou wicked woman,' said her father roughly to her; 'get
      thee ready quickly to leave this heathen land and return to thy own
      country, where thou shalt be wife to this good man, Opataia, who desires
      thee still.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is well, my father,' said Tui; 'but yet leave us now for a little.
      Surely if this man desires me for his house he can speak to me with his
      own mouth, and not through thine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So her father went without the house, and Opataia, the white man,
      remained with Tui.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then said the evil-faced white man to Tui: 'For the wrong that thou
      did'st me by running away with that evil white man do I forgive thee, for
      I love thee well.' And then he put his arms about her, and sought to
      embrace her after the manner of a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then from beneath her gown did Tui take out a little gun that fires
      six bullets; and as the fat man, Opataia, pressed her to his bosom and
      heeded not what she did, she placed the mouth of the little gun to the
      side of his fat head. Then she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This do I, dog, for the husband of whom thou hast robbed me,' and then
      there came a flash and a cry, and the white man sprang to his feet and
      fell forward on his face&mdash;dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Tui ran from the house. She fled from her father and came towards
      the village, and Tepuaka the King followed her with death in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Kill her!' he called to the men of Niuafou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then we men of Anuda sprang to her aid with our clubs in our hands,
      and she ran into our midst and called to us to save her from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there was much talk, and then her father's wrath began to subside, for
      we made him many presents of food for his journey back, and he went away
